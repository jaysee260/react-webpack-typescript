# react-webpack-typescript

Boilerplate code for a development environment with React, TypeScript and Sass. Bundled by Webpack.

Unfinished. Proper setup of HotReloadModule is __pending__. Site content is getting updated but page gets reloaded and state is lost.

If you'd like to help, just fork, make fix, and submit a pull request; your contribution would be appreciated!
